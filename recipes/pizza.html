    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
            <p><em>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and

        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong>
            <p><em>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can

                    12-inch circle.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong>
            <p><em>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong>
            <p><em>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Step 8</strong>

        </li>
    </ol>
